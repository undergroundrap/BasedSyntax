# BasedSyntax

**BasedSyntax** is a powerful, locally-run coding assistant that supercharges your development workflow. It combines the advanced Monaco editor (the engine behind VS Code) with the flexibility of local AI models via Ollama. Use it as a scratchpad, a learning tool, or a powerful code refactoring and analysis companion, all while keeping your code securely on your own machine.
